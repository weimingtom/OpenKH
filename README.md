OpenKH(PROJECT DISCONTINUED SEE BELOW)
======
OpenKH is an open source project that will allow us to 
launch Kingdom Hearts games on pc, with builted-in editors, custom 3d motor, etc...
The purpose of this project is to allow fans to easily mod the KH games, create fangames, etc...
This project got 2 "min" parts:

LIBKH

This part is a dll that will take proprietary KH formats like IMGD, PAX, MDLX, MDLS, etc.... and will convert them into a readable format like VAG > WAV, BGM > MIDI, IMGD > PNG etc...
This part is necessary for OpenKH.

OpenKH

This will contains things like the 3d motors. It will contain the complete ELF reversed code(or the ExeFs or other things for other games)


For now we're focusing on the 2 main games, KH1(FM) and KH2(FM)
The process's takin' long time b\c I'm(GovanifY) the one working on this project when I'm writing this words. Any request for helping can be sended on my personal mail: govanify@gmail.com

The project is entirely C# but we will surely re-write it in a near future on C++.

/!\THIS PROJECT IS ALMOST ABANDONNED NOW DON'T EXPECT NEW THINGS BEFORE A WHILE/!\

2nd EDIT: I actually really abandonned the project, kinda makin' new shits privately but not contributing to Xeey repo anymore since I'm the only one.
